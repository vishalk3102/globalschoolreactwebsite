              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                To bring together the traditions and ethos of India with modern
                technology in an environment where every child is an individual.
                The Global School is a day boarding school in Dehradun which
                offers English medium, secular, co-educational education from
                classes Nursery to XII. The School is affiliated to the Central
                Board of Secondary Education. There is no better place for a
                child to appreciate the joys of nature and to become
                environmentally conscious. The view of the Himalayas from
                School, abundance of trees, and the chatter of a myriad variety
                of birds enhance joy of learning. We believe that responding
                positively to the genuine needs of our students determines our
                success.

              <h3>School Infrastructure</h3>
              <p>
                The School is situated on a 16-acre campus, ‘Global Acres’ in
                tranquil and verdant environs. The academic building is an
                impressive structure designed by a well-known group of
                architects from New Delhi. The residential area set amidst
                greenery with students being provided their own recreational
                area. We have four hostels, 2 for senior boys, 1 for junior
                boys, and one separate hostel for girls. A housemaster, tutors,
                and a matron live within the Student House providing round the
                clock supervision. The students are housed in three separate
                hostels – one each for junior boys, senior boys, and girls. The
                hostels are located in a way that the senior boys do not have
                easy access to the girls hostels. A 25m swimming pool, table
                tennis, and badminton halls, gymnasium, three larger sports
                fields, dining hall, activity rooms, and a gymnasium provide
                activity-based experiences and leisure pursuits for the children
                in their spare time. Conscious efforts are made to teach the
                reading habit and develop communication skills. In the middle
                section (VI to VIII), teachers integrate technology into the
                learning process. In the senior section (IX to XII) the focus is
                on achieving “good results” at the board’s examination
